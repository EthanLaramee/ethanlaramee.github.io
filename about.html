        Hi, my name is Ethan Laramee. I am majoring in Mechanical Engineering and looking to minor in Computer Science at the 
        <a target="_blank" href="https://www.uri.edu"> University of Rhode Island</a>.
        I am from West Warwick, Rhode Island, where I have lived my whole life. I graduated from my local public high school, 
        <a target="_blank" href="https://sites.google.com/westwarwickpublicschools.com/westwarwickhighschool/home">West Warwick High School</a>.
        I have a couple of hobies which take up a lot of my time. A hobby that I have had since the age of 5 is hockey. In highschool I was able to 
        win the division 3 state championship in my junior year, and become the captian of the team my senior year.
        I also recently bought a <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buick_Skylark#1961â€“1963"> 1962 Buick Skylark<a>, 
        as a project car, in the summer of 2021. It is currently not running and needs a paintjob but, for a northeastern car that is 60 years old, 
        it is in pretty good condition! I have also traveled to many places outside of the United States. 
        I have visited my mothers birthplace in Uruguay, my grandfather who lives in Spain, and Paris,France with my cousins!
