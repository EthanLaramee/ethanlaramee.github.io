      <h1>About Me</h1>
      <p> Hi, my name is Ethan Laramee. I am majoring in Mechanical Engineering and looking to minor in Computer Science at the University of Rhode Island. <br>
        I am from West Warwick, Rhode Island, where I have lived my whole life. I graduated from my local public high school, West Warwick High School. <br>
        I have been playing hockey since the age of 5 and was the captian of my highschool hockey team. I also recently bought a 1962 Buick Skylark, as a project car, in the summer of 2021. <br>
