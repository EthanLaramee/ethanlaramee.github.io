        I am from West Warwick, Rhode Island, where I have lived my whole life. I graduated from my local public high school,

        I have been playing hockey since the age of 5 and was the captian of my highschool hockey team. 
        I also recently bought a <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buick_Skylark#1961â€“1963"> 1962 Buick Skylark<a>, as a project car, in the summer of 2021. <br>
