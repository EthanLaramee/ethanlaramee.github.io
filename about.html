      <p> Hi, my name is Ethan Laramee. I am majoring in Mechanical Engineering and looking to minor in Computer Science at the 
        <a href="https://www.uri.edu"> University of Rhode Island</a>. <br>
        I am from West Warwick, Rhode Island, where I have lived my whole life. I graduated from my local public high school, 
        <a target="_blank" href="https://sites.google.com/westwarwickpublicschools.com/westwarwickhighschool/home">West Warwick High School</a>. <br>
        I have been playing hockey since the age of 5 and was the captian of my highschool hockey team. 
        I also recently bought a <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buick_Skylark#1961â€“1963"> 1962 Buick Skylark<a>, 
        as a project car, in the summer of 2021. <br>
