      <h1>Final Project</h1>
        <p>In this game the goal is to dodge the barrels that are falling from the sky while also collecting the coins that fall.<br>
            For every coin you collect you earn 5 points, but every time yo get hit by a barrel you lose 1 life and 10 points. <br>
            You start out with three lives and you can collect extra lives, but they fall at an decreasing rate as the game goes on.<br>
            When you run out of lives the game will end and you have the option of retrying or returning to the main menu. <br>
            <br>
            Another additional feature to our game is the customization area. With this you can select the shirt, pants, and hair color <br>
            of the main character in the game. <br>
