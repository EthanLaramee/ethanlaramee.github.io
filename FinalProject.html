      <h1>Final Project</h1>
        <p>In this game, the goal is to dodge the barrels that are falling from the sky while also collecting the coins that fall.<br>
            For every coin you collect you will earn 5 points, but every time you get hit by a barrel you will lose 10 points and 1 life. <br>
            You start out with three lives and you can collect extra lives throughout the game, but they fall at an decreasing rate as the game goes on.<br>
            The game contains levels, based on your current score, where the speed will increase the higher your score. <br>
            To move you use the arrow keys, and if you would like to sprint press the "SHIFT" key. Sprinting does not last forever, you can only<br>
            hold it down for 5 seconds at a time. When you run out of lives the game will end, you will be shown your final score, and you have <br>
            the option of replaying or returning to the main menu. <br>
            <br>
            Another additional feature to our game is the customization area. With this you can select the shirt, pants, and hair color <br>
            of the main character in the game.<br>
